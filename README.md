# Regression-Tree-and-Bagging-C-code
The C++ code for regression tree and bagging. Used standard libraries only.

There are three headers. Both "Point.h" and "Bagging.h" are utility headers.

**Points.h** contains the basic structure for n-d points, the structure for n-d points vectors, and some utility function.

**Bagging.h** contains the bagging method that splits the original data into several batches.
